title: Jump Upgrading to Ops Manager v2.10
owner: Ops Manager
---

<%= vars.ops_manager %> v2.4 and later can now upgrade directly to <%= vars.ops_manager %> v2.10.

To upgrade to <%= vars.ops_manager %> v2.10, you must ensure that the products you have installed are also compatible with <%= vars.ops_manager %> v2.10 before performing the upgrade.

## <a id="prerequisites"></a> Prerequisites

Before you jump upgrade:

-   Foundations must be running <%= vars.ops_manager %> v2.4 or later.

-   The target upgrade version of <%= vars.ops_manager %> must be v2.10.2 or later.

-   All product tiles must list compatibility with the target version of <%= vars.ops_manager %>. For more information on creating an upgrade path for your product tiles, see the [Upgrade Planner](https://upgrade-planner.pivotal.io/).

-   You have no staged changes to any product tile or service instance.

-   If you are using vSphere with NSX-T, you must be running NSX-T v2.3 or later. NSX-T thats compatible with their current OpsManager version and Ops Manager 2.10.

-   You are running Trusty stemcell 3541 or higher.

After you have verified everything in the Eligibility section, you can upgrade <%= vars.ops_manager %> to v2.10.2 and later by following the steps here.

Step Upgrading <%= vars.ops_manager %> Docs that talks about upgrading <%= vars.ops_manager %> and TAS together: [Upgrading <%= vars.ops_manager %>](https://docs.pivotal.io/platform/2-10/customizing/upgrading-pcf.html)

## <a id="after-jump-upgrade"></a> After You Jump Upgrade

After you jump upgrade:

-   There are several breaking API changes. Direct API automation used with their older version might need minor updates. See the consolidated breaking changes and known issues for a complete list.

-   Credhub-based BOSH Certificates, included certificate authorities (CAs), for Maestro-compatible products are now rotated with Maestro. For more information, see an introduction to Maestro.

-   Products that are not Maestro-compatible can still be used with OpsManager v2.10, but their certificate authorities cannot be rotated and will eventually expire.
