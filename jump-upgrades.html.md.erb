title: Jump Upgrading to Ops Manager v2.10
owner: Ops Manager
---

Customers running versions of OpsManager with at least version 2.4.0 can now directly upgrade to OpsManager 2.10 LTS. Like any other minor version upgrade, customers must ensure that the products they have installed are also compatible with OpsManager 2.10 before performing the upgrade.

## <a id="prerequisites"></a> Prerequisites

Before you jump upgrade:

-   Foundations must be running Ops Manager v2.4 or later.

-   The target upgrade version of Ops Manager must be v2.10.2 or later.

-   All product tiles must list compatibility with the target version of Ops Manager.

-   You have no staged changes to any product tile or service instance.

-   If you are using vSphere with NSX-T, you must be running NSX-T v2.3 or later. NSX-T thats compatible with their current OpsManager version and Ops Manager 2.10.

-   Customers should be running Trusty stemcell 3541 or higher before they jump upgrade to 2.10.

-   You can use the [Upgrade Planner](https://upgrade-planner.pivotal.io/) to figure out the upgrade path for your foundation.Â

## After Jump Upgrading

After you jump upgrade:

-   There are several breaking API changes. Direct API automation used with their older version might need minor updates. See the consolidated breaking changes and known issues for a complete list.

-   Credhub-based BOSH Certificates, included certificate authorities (CAs), for Maestro-compatible products are now rotated with Maestro. For more information, see an introduction to Maestro.

-   Products that are not Maestro-compatible can still be used with OpsManager v2.10, but their certificate authorities cannot be rotated and will eventually expire.
