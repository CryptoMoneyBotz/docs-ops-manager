This topic describes how to configure the Ops Manager Director for VMware vSphere.

Before you begin this procedure, ensure that you have successfully completed all steps in the [Deploying BOSH and Ops Manager to vSphere](deploy.html) topic.
After you complete this procedure, follow the configuration instructions for the runtime you choose to install.
For example, to install Pivotal Application Service (PAS), see the [Deploying PAS on vSphere](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-0/customizing/config-er-vmware.html) topic.

See [Installing Runtimes](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-0/customizing/runtimes.html) for more information about Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) runtimes.

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> You can also perform the procedures in this topic using the Ops Manager API. For more information, see the <a href="https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-0/customizing/ops-man-api.html">Using the Ops Manager API</a> topic.</p>


## <a id="set-up"></a> Step 1: Set Up Ops Manager

1. Navigate to the fully qualified domain of your Ops Manager in a web browser.

1. The first time you start Ops Manager, you must choose one of the following:
    * [Use an Identity Provider](#idp): If you use an Identity Provider, an external identity server maintains your user database.
    * [Internal Authentication](#internal): If you use Internal Authentication, PCF maintains your user database.

<%= image_tag("../common/images/select-authentication.png") %>

### <a id='idp'></a> Use an Identity Provider

<%= partial '../common/using_idp_ops_manager' %>

### <a id='internal'></a> Internal Authentication

1. When redirected to the **Internal Authentication** page, you must complete the following steps:
    * Enter a **Username**, **Password**, and **Password confirmation** to create an Admin user.
    * Enter a **Decryption passphrase** and the **Decryption passphrase confirmation**. This passphrase encrypts the Ops Manager datastore, and is not recoverable.
    * If you are using an **HTTP proxy** or **HTTPS proxy**, follow the instructions in the [Configuring Proxy Settings for the BOSH CPI](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-0/customizing/pcf-director-proxy-settings.html) topic.
    * Read the **End User License Agreement**, and select the checkbox to accept the terms.

## <a id='vcenter-config'></a> Step 2: vCenter Config Page

1. Log in to Ops Manager with the Admin username and password you created in the previous step.

    <%= image_tag("../common/images/cf-login.png") %>

1. Click the **Ops Manager Director** tile.

    <%= image_tag("../common/images/vsphere-tile.png") %>

1. Select **vCenter Config**.

    <%= image_tag("../common/images/vcenter-config.png") %>

1. Enter the following information:
    * **vCenter Host**: The hostname of the vCenter that manages ESXi/vSphere.
    * **vCenter Username**: A vCenter username with create and delete privileges for virtual machines (VMs) and folders.
    * **vCenter Password**: The password for the vCenter user specified above.
    * **Datacenter Name**: The name of the datacenter as it appears in vCenter.
    * **Virtual Disk Type**: The Virtual Disk Type to provision for all VMs. For guidance about the virtual disk type to select, see [Provisioning a Virtual Disk in vSphere](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-0/customizing/disk-format.html).
    <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> The following fields do not allow whitespace. Including whitespace characters in datastore or datastore folder names causes an error.</p>
    * **Ephemeral Datastore Names (comma delimited)**: The names of the datastores that store ephemeral VM disks deployed by Ops Manager.
    * **Persistent Datastore Names (comma delimited)**: The names of the datastores that store persistent VM disks deployed by Ops Manager.
    * **VM Folder**: The vSphere datacenter folder (default: `pcf_vms`) where Ops Manager places VMs.
    * **Template Folder**: The vSphere datacenter folder (default: `pcf_templates`) where Ops Manager places VMs.
    * **Disk path Folder**: The vSphere datastore folder (default: `pcf_disk`) where Ops Manager creates attached disk images. You must not nest this folder.

1. Select a network configuration from one of the following:
    * **Standard vCenter Networking**: This is the default option when upgrading Ops Manager.
    * **NSX Networking**: Select this option to enable VMware NSX Network Virtualization.

    <%= image_tag("../common/images/NSXdirectorconfig.png") %>

1. Configure NSX networking by entering the following information:
    * **NSX Mode**: Select either **NSX-V** or **NSX-T**.
    * **NSX Address**: The address of the NSX manager.
    * **NSX Username**: The username to connect to the NSX manager.
    * **NSX Password**: The password for the username specified above.
    * **NSX CA Cert**: A CA certificate in PEM format that authenticates to the NSX server.
    If the NSX Manager generated a self-signed certificate, you can retrieve the CA certificate using OpenSSL with the following command: `openssl s_client -showcerts -connect NSX-MANAGER-ADDRESS:443 < /dev/null 2> /dev/null | openssl x509`
    <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> To update NSX security group and load balancer information, see the <a href="https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-0/customizing/update-nsx.html">Updating NSX Security Group and Load Balancer Information</a> topic.</p>

1. Click **Save**.

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> After your initial deployment, you will not be able to edit the VM Folder, Template Folder, and Disk path Folder names.</p>


## <a id='dir-config'></a> Step 3: Director Config Page

1. Select **Director Config**.

    <%= image_tag("../common/images/vsphere_director.png") %>

1. In the **NTP Servers (comma delimited)** field, enter your NTP server addresses.

    <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> The NTP server configuration only updates
    after VM recreation. Ensure that you select the <strong>Recreate all VMs</strong> checkbox
    if you modify the value of this field.</p>

1. Leave the **JMX Provider IP Address** field blank.
    <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> Starting from PCF v2.0, BOSH-reported component metrics are available in the Loggregator Firehose by default. Therefore, if you continue to use PCF JMX Bridge for consuming them outside of the Firehose, you may receive duplicate data. To prevent this, leave the <strong>JMX Provider IP Address</strong> field blank. For additional guidance, see <a href="https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-0/pcf-release-notes/runtime-rn.html#bosh-metrics">BOSH System Metrics Available in Loggregator Firehose</a>.</p>

1. Leave the **Bosh HM Forwarder IP Address** field blank.
    <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> Starting from PCF v2.0, BOSH-reported component metrics are available in the Loggregator Firehose by default. Therefore, if you continue to use the BOSH HM Forwarder for consuming them, you may receive duplicate data. To prevent this, leave the <strong>Bosh HM Forwarder IP Address</strong> field blank. For additional guidance, see <a href="https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-0/pcf-release-notes/runtime-rn.html#bosh-metrics">BOSH System Metrics Available in Loggregator Firehose</a>.</p>

1. Select the **Enable VM Resurrector Plugin** to enable Ops Manager Resurrector functionality. If you are installing PAS, this setting also increases availability in your deployment. For more information, see the [Using Ops Manager Resurrector on VMware vSphere](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-0/customizing/resurrector.html) topic.

1. Select **Enable Post Deploy Scripts** to run a post-deploy script after deployment. This script allows the job to execute additional commands against a deployment.
  <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> If you are deploying Pivotal Container Service (PKS), you must enable post-deploy scripts.</p>

1. Select **Recreate all VMs** to force BOSH to recreate all VMs on the next deploy. This process does not destroy any persistent disk data.

1. Select **Enable bosh deploy retries** if you want Ops Manager to retry failed BOSH operations up to five times.

1. Select **Keep Unreachable Director VMs** if you want to preserve Ops Manager Director VMs after a failed deployment for troubleshooting purposes.

1. Select **HM Pager Duty Plugin** to enable Health Monitor integration with PagerDuty.
    <%= image_tag("../common/images/director_hm_pager.png") %>
    * **Service Key**: Enter your API service key from PagerDuty.
    * **HTTP Proxy**: Enter an HTTP proxy for use with PagerDuty.

1. Select **HM Email Plugin** to enable Health Monitor integration with email.

    * **Username**: Enter the username for your email server.
    * **Password**: Enter the password for your email server.
    * **Enable TLS**: Select this checkbox to enable Transport Layer Security.

1. For **Blobstore Location**, Pivotal recommends that you select **Internal**. However, if you select **S3 Compatible Blobstore**, complete the **S3 Endpoint**, **Bucket Name**, **Access Key**, **Secret Key**, **V2 Signature/V4 Signature**, and **Region** with information from your blobstore provider.

    <%= image_tag("../common/images/director_blobstore.png") %>

1. By default, PCF deploys and manages an **Internal** database for you. If you choose to use an **External MySQL Database**, complete the associated fields with information obtained from your external MySQL Database provider: **Host**, **Port**, **Username**, **Password**, and **Database**.

    <%= image_tag("../common/images/director_database.png") %>

1. (Optional) **Director Workers** sets the number of workers available to execute Director tasks. This field defaults to `5`.

1. (Optional) **Max Threads** sets the maximum number of threads that the BOSH Director can run simultaneously. For vSphere, the default value is `32`. Leave the field blank to use this default value. Pivotal recommends that you use the default value unless doing so results in rate limiting or errors on your IaaS.

1. (Optional) To add a custom URL for your BOSH Director, enter a valid hostname in **Director Hostname**. You can also use this field to configure a load balancer in front of your Ops Manager Director. For more information, see [How to Set Up a Load Balancer in Front of Ops Manager Director](https://discuss.pivotal.io/hc/en-us/articles/225420588) in the Pivotal Knowledge Base.
    <p class="note warning"><strong>WARNING: </strong>In Ops Manager v2.0.25 and earlier, if you change the <strong>Director
  Hostname</strong> after your initial deployment, VMs become unavailable. This causes PCF downtime. To restore VM availability, enable **Recreate All VMs** and redeploy. This issue is resolved in <a href="https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-0/pcf-release-notes/opsmanager-rn.html#2-0-26">Ops Manager v2.0.26</a> and later.</p>

1. <%= partial "../common/exclude-recursors" %>

1. (Optional) To disable BOSH DNS, select the **Disable BOSH DNS server for troubleshooting purposes** checkbox. For more information about the BOSH DNS service discovery mechanism, see [BOSH DNS Service Discovery for Application Containers](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-0/pcf-release-notes/runtime-rn.html#bosh-dns) in the PAS Release Notes.
  <p class="note breaking"><strong>Breaking Change:</strong> Do not disable BOSH DNS without consulting Pivotal Support. If you opt out of the BOSH DNS feature, your PCF deployment cannot support <a href="https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-0/pcf-release-notes/opsmanager-rn.html#nsx">NSX-T networking</a>. For more information about disabling BOSH DNS, see <a href="https://discuss.pivotal.io/hc/en-us/articles/115015720428-Disabling-or-Opting-Out-of-BOSH-DNS-in-PCF">Disabling or Opting Out of BOSH DNS in PCF</a> in the Pivotal Knowledge Base.</p>
  <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> If you are deploying PKS, do not disable BOSH DNS. If PAS and PKS are running on the same instance of Ops Manager, you cannot use the opt-out feature of BOSH DNS for your PAS without breaking PKS. If you want to opt out of BOSH DNS in your PAS deployment, install the tile on a separate instance of Ops Manager.</p>

1. (Optional) To set a custom banner that users see when logging in to the Director using SSH, enter text in the **Custom SSH Banner** field.
  <%= image_tag("../common/images/disable-bosh-dns.png") %>

1. Click **Save**.

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> After your initial deployment, you cannot edit the Blobstore and Database locations.</p>


## <a id='create-az'></a> Step 4: Create Availability Zone Page

Ops Manager Availability Zones (AZs) correspond to your vCenter clusters and resource pools. Multiple Availability Zones allow you to provide high-availability and load balancing to your apps. When you run more than one instance of an app, Ops Manager balances those instances across all of the Availability Zones assigned to the app. Pivotal recommends using at least three availability zones for a highly available installation of your chosen runtime.

1. Select **Create Availability Zones**.

    <%= image_tag("../common/images/create-az.png") %>

1. Use the following steps to create one or more Availability Zones for your apps to use:
    * Click **Add**.
    * Enter a unique **Name** for the Availability Zone.
    * Enter the name of an existing vCenter **Cluster** to use as an Availability Zone.
    * **(Optional)** Enter the name of a **Resource Pool** in the vCenter cluster that you specified above. The jobs running in this Availability Zone share the CPU and memory resources defined by the pool.
    <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> For the PAS runtime, see
<a href="https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-0/customizing/understand-az.html">Availability Zones in vSphere</a> for additional information.</p>

1. Click **Save**.


## <a id='create-networks'></a> Step 5: Create Networks Page

1. Select **Create Networks**.

    <%= image_tag("../common/images/create-network.png") %>

1. Select **Enable ICMP checks** to enable ICMP on your networks. Ops Manager uses ICMP checks to confirm that components within your network are reachable.

1. Use the following steps to create one or more Ops Manager networks:
    * Click **Add Network**.
    * Enter a unique **Name** for the network.
    *  If you want to dynamically provision VMs in this network for use with on-demand services, select the **Service Networks** checkbox. When the checkbox is selected, Ops Manager does not provision VMs within the specified CIDR range.
    * Click **Add Subnet** to create one or more subnets for the network.
    * Enter the full path and **vSphere Network Name** as it displays in vCenter. For example, enter `YOUR-DIRECTORY-NAME/YOUR-NETWORK-NAME`. If your vSphere Network Name contains a forward slash character, replace the forward slash with the URL-encoded forward slash character `%2f`.
    * For **CIDR**, enter a valid CIDR block in which to deploy VMs. For example, enter `192.0.2.0/24`.
    * For **Reserved IP Ranges**, enter any IP addresses from the **CIDR**
    that you want to blacklist from the installation. Ops Manager will not deploy VMs to any address in this range.
    * Enter your **DNS** and **Gateway** IP addresses.
    * Select which **Availability Zones** to use with the network.

1. Click **Save**.
    <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> Multiple networks allow you to place vCenter on a private network and the rest of your deployment on a public network. Isolating vCenter in this manner denies access to it from outside sources and reduces possible security vulnerabilities.
    </p>
    <p class='note'><strong>Note:</strong> If you are using the Cisco Nexus
      1000v Switch, refer to the <a href="https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-0/customizing/nexus-switch.html">Using the Cisco
      Nexus 1000v Switch with Ops Manager</a> topic for more information.
    </p>


## <a id='assign-azs'></a> Step 6: Assign AZs and Networks Page

1. Select **Assign AZs and Networks**.
<%= image_tag("../common/images/assign-az.png") %>

1. Use the drop-down menu to select a **Singleton Availability Zone**. The Ops Manager Director installs in this Availability Zone.

1. Use the drop-down menu to select a **Network** for your Ops Manager Director.

1. Click **Save**.


## <a id='security-config'></a> Step 7: Security Page

<%= partial "../common/security-pane" %>

## <a id='syslog'></a> Step 8: Syslog Page

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> BOSH Director logs contain sensitive information that should be considered privileged. For example, these logs may contain cloud provider credentials. If you choose to forward logs to an external syslog endpoint, Pivotal recommends using TLS encryption to prevent information from being intercepted by a third party.</p>

<%= partial '../common/syslog_bosh' %>

## <a id='resource-config'></a> Step 9: Resource Config Page

1. Select **Resource Config**.

    <%= image_tag("../common/images/vsphere-om-resources.png") %>

1. Adjust any values as necessary for your deployment. Under the **Instances**, **Persistent Disk Type**, and **VM Type** fields, choose **Automatic** from the drop-down menu to allocate the recommended resources for the job. If the **Persistent Disk Type** field reads **None**, the job does not require persistent disk space.
    <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> If you set a field to <strong>Automatic</strong> and the recommended resource allocation changes in a future version, Ops Manager automatically uses the updated recommended allocation.</p>

1. Click **Save**.


## <a id='complete-installation'></a> Step 10: Complete the Ops Manager Director Installation

1. Click the **Installation Dashboard** link to return to the Installation Dashboard.

1. Click **Apply Changes** on the right navigation.

1. After you complete this procedure, follow the instructions in the [Deploying PAS on vSphere](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-0/customizing/config-er-vmware.html) topic.
