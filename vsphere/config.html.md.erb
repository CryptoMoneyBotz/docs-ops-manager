This topic describes how to configure the BOSH Director tile for VMware vSphere.
You can also perform the procedures in this topic using the Ops Manager API.
For more information, see
[Using the Ops Manager API](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/<%= product_info['local_product_version'].to_s.sub('.','-') %>/customizing/ops-man-api.html).

<p class="note warning"><strong>WARNING:</strong> If you are installing Pivotal Container Service (PKS)
on vSphere with NSX-T integration, follow the instructions in
<a href="https://docs.pivotal.io/runtimes/pks/1-1/vsphere-nsxt-om-config.html">Configuring BOSH Director with NSX-T for PKS</a>
instead of performing the steps provided in this topic.</p>

## <a id="prerequisites"></a> Prerequisites

Before you begin this procedure, you must complete all steps in [Deploying Ops Manager on vSphere](./deploy.html).

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Pivotal strongly recommends installing PAS and PKS on separate instances of Ops Manager for security reasons. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.pivotal.io/runtimes/pks/pas-and-pks.html">PAS and PKS Deployments with Ops Manager</a>.</p>

## <a id="set-up"></a> Step 1: Set Up Ops Manager

1. In a web browser, navigate to the fully qualified domain of your Ops Manager.

1. When Ops Manager starts for the first time, you must choose one of the following:
    * [Use an Identity Provider](#idp): If you choose **Use an Identity Provider**, an external
      identity server maintains your user database.
    * [Internal Authentication](#internal): If you choose **Internal Authentication**, Ops Manager
      maintains your user database.

<%= image_tag("../common/images/select-authentication.png") %>

### <a id='idp'></a> Use an Identity Provider

<%= partial '../common/using_idp_ops_manager' %>

### <a id='internal'></a> Use Internal Authentication

1. When redirected to the **Internal Authentication** page, you must complete the following steps:
    * Enter a **Username**, **Password**, and **Password confirmation** to create an Admin user.
    * Enter a **Decryption passphrase** and the **Decryption passphrase confirmation**. This passphrase encrypts the Ops Manager datastore, and is not recoverable.
    * If you are using an **HTTP proxy** or **HTTPS proxy**, follow the instructions in [Configuring Proxy Settings for the BOSH CPI](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/<%= product_info['local_product_version'].to_s.sub('.','-') %>/customizing/pcf-director-proxy-settings.html).
    * Read the **End User License Agreement**, and select the checkbox to accept the terms.

    <%= image_tag("../common/images/om-login.png") %>

## <a id='vcenter-config'></a> Step 2: vCenter Config Page

1. Log in to Ops Manager with the Admin username and password that you created in the previous step.

    <%= image_tag("../common/images/cf-login.png") %>

1. Click the **BOSH Director** tile.

    <%= image_tag("../common/images/director-tile-vmware.png") %>

1. Select **vCenter Config**.

    <%= image_tag("../common/images/vcenter-config.png") %>

1. Enter the following information:
    * **vCenter Host**: The hostname of the vCenter that manages ESXi/vSphere.
    * **vCenter Username**: A vCenter username with create and delete privileges for virtual machines (VMs) and folders.
    * **vCenter Password**: The password for the vCenter user specified above.
    * **Datacenter Name**: The name of the datacenter as it appears in vCenter.
    * **Virtual Disk Type**: The Virtual Disk Type to provision for all VMs. For guidance about the virtual disk type to select, see [Provisioning a Virtual Disk in vSphere](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-1/customizing/disk-format.html).
    <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> The following fields do not allow whitespace. Including whitespace characters in datastore or datastore folder names causes an error.</p>
    * **Ephemeral Datastore Names (comma delimited)**: The names of the datastores that store ephemeral VM disks deployed by Ops Manager.
    * **Persistent Datastore Names (comma delimited)**: The names of the datastores that store persistent VM disks deployed by Ops Manager.
    * **VM Folder**: The vSphere datacenter folder where Ops Manager places VMs. This defaults to `pcf_vms`.
    * **Template Folder**: The vSphere datacenter folder where Ops Manager places VMs. This defaults to `pcf_templates`.
    * **Disk path Folder**: The vSphere datastore folder where Ops Manager creates attached disk images. This defaults to `pcf_disk`. You must not nest this folder.

1. Select a network configuration from one of the following:
    * **Standard vCenter Networking**: This is the default option when upgrading Ops Manager.
    * **NSX Networking**: Select this option to enable VMware NSX Network Virtualization.
    <%= image_tag("../common/images/NSXdirectorconfig.png") %>
        Configure NSX networking by entering the following information:
        * **NSX Mode**: Select either **NSX-V** or **NSX-T**.
        <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> If you want to configure NSX Networking for PKS,
        you must select <strong>NSX-T</strong>. For more information about NSX Networking for PKS, see
        the <a href="https://docs.pivotal.io/runtimes/pks/1-1/vsphere-nsxt-om-config.html#vcenter-config">Configure vCenter for PKS</a>
        section of <em>Configuring BOSH Director with NSX-T for PKS</em>.</p>
        * **NSX Address**: The address of the NSX manager.
        * **NSX Username**: The username to connect to the NSX manager.
        * **NSX Password**: The password for the username specified above.
        * **NSX CA Cert**: A CA certificate in PEM format that authenticates to the NSX server.
        If the NSX Manager generated a self-signed certificate, use the following command to retrieve the CA certificate using OpenSSL:

            ```
            openssl s_client -showcerts -connect NSX-MANAGER-ADDRESS:443 < /dev/null 2> /dev/null | openssl x509
            ```
            Where `NSX-MANAGER-ADDRESS` is the address of the NSX manager.

1. Click **Save**.
  <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> After your initial deployment, you cannot edit the VM Folder, Template Folder, and Disk path Folder names.</p>


## <a id='dir-config'></a> Step 3: Director Config Page

1. Select **Director Config**.

    <%= image_tag("../common/images/vsphere_director.png") %>

1. In the **NTP Servers (comma delimited)** field, enter your NTP server addresses.

    <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> The NTP server configuration only updates
    after VM recreation. Ensure that you select the <strong>Recreate all VMs</strong> checkbox
    if you modify the value of this field.</p>

1. Leave the **JMX Provider IP Address** field blank.
    <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> Starting in PCF v2.0, BOSH-reported component metrics are available in the Loggregator Firehose by default. If you continue to use PCF JMX Bridge to consume these component metrics outside of the Firehose, you may receive duplicate data. To prevent this, leave the <strong>JMX Provider IP Address</strong> field blank. For additional guidance, see <a href="https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-0/pcf-release-notes/runtime-rn.html#bosh-metrics">BOSH System Metrics Available in Loggregator Firehose</a>.</p>

1. Leave the **Bosh HM Forwarder IP Address** field blank.
    <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> Starting in PCF v2.0, BOSH-reported component metrics are available in the Loggregator Firehose by default. If you continue to use the BOSH HM Forwarder for consuming them, you may receive duplicate data. To prevent this, leave the <strong>Bosh HM Forwarder IP Address</strong> field blank. For additional guidance, see <a href="https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-0/pcf-release-notes/runtime-rn.html#bosh-metrics">BOSH System Metrics Available in Loggregator Firehose</a>.</p>

1. Select the **Enable VM Resurrector Plugin** to enable Ops Manager Resurrector functionality and
increase your runtime availability. If you intend to install PAS, see [Using Ops Manager Resurrector on VMware vSphere](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-1/customizing/resurrector.html)
for more information about the Resurrector plugin.

1. Select **Enable Post Deploy Scripts** to run a post-deploy script after deployment. This script allows the job to execute additional commands against a deployment.
  <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> You must enable post-deploy scripts to install PKS.</p>

1. Select **Recreate all VMs** to force BOSH to recreate all VMs on the next deploy. This process does not destroy any persistent disk data.

1. Select **Enable bosh deploy retries** to instruct Ops Manager to retry failed BOSH operations up to five times.

1. Select **Keep Unreachable Director VMs** if you want to preserve BOSH Director VMs after a failed deployment for troubleshooting purposes.

1. By default, Ops Manager deploys and manages an **Internal** database for you. If you choose to use an **External MySQL Database**, complete the associated fields with information obtained from your external MySQL Database provider: **Host**, **Port**, **Username**, **Password**, and **Database**.

    <%= image_tag("../common/images/director_database.png") %>

1. (Optional) **Director Workers** sets the number of workers available to execute Director tasks. This field defaults to `5`.

1. (Optional) **Max Threads** sets the maximum number of threads that the BOSH Director can run simultaneously. For vSphere, the default value is `32`. Leave the field blank to use this default value. Pivotal recommends that you use the default value unless doing so results in rate limiting or errors on your IaaS.

1. (Optional) To add a custom URL for your BOSH Director, enter a valid hostname in **Director Hostname**. You can also use this field to configure a load balancer in front of your Ops Manager Director. For more information, see [How to Set Up a Load Balancer in Front of Ops Manager Director](https://community.pivotal.io/s/article/How-to-Set-Up-a-Load-Balancer-in-Front-of-Ops-Manager-Director) in the Pivotal Knowledge Base.
     <p class="note warning"><strong>WARNING: </strong>In Ops Manager v2.1.17 and earlier, if you change the <strong>Director
     Hostname</strong> after your initial deployment, VMs become unavailable. This causes PCF downtime. To restore VM availability, enable **Recreate All VMs** and redeploy. This issue is resolved in <a href="https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-1/pcf-release-notes/opsmanager-rn.html#2-1-18">Ops Manager v2.1.18</a> and later.</p>

1. <%= partial "../common/exclude-recursors" %>

1. (Optional) To disable BOSH DNS, select the **Disable BOSH DNS server for troubleshooting purposes** checkbox. For more information about the BOSH DNS service discovery mechanism, see [BOSH DNS Service Discovery for Application Containers](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-0/pcf-release-notes/runtime-rn.html#bosh-dns) in the PAS Release Notes.
  <p class="note breaking"><strong>Breaking Change:</strong> Do not disable BOSH DNS without consulting Pivotal Support. If you opt out of the BOSH DNS feature, your PCF deployment cannot support <a href="https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-0/pcf-release-notes/opsmanager-rn.html#nsx">NSX-T networking</a>. For more information about disabling BOSH DNS, see <a href="https://discuss.pivotal.io/hc/en-us/articles/115015720428-Disabling-or-Opting-Out-of-BOSH-DNS-in-PCF">Disabling or Opting Out of BOSH DNS in PCF</a> in the Pivotal Knowledge Base.</p>
  <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> If you are deploying PKS, do not disable BOSH DNS. If PAS and PKS are running on the same instance of Ops Manager, you cannot use the opt-out feature of BOSH DNS for your PAS without breaking PKS. If you want to opt out of BOSH DNS in your PAS deployment, install the tile on a separate instance of Ops Manager.</p>

1. (Optional) To set a custom banner that users see when logging in to the Director using SSH, enter text in the **Custom SSH Banner** field.
  <%= image_tag("../common/images/disable-bosh-dns.png") %>

1. Click **Save**.

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> After your initial deployment, you cannot edit the Blobstore and Database locations.</p>


## <a id='create-az'></a> Step 4: Create Availability Zone Page

Ops Manager Availability Zones (AZs) correspond to your vCenter clusters and resource pools. Multiple Availability Zones allow you to provide high-availability and load balancing to your apps. When you run more than one instance of an app, Ops Manager balances those instances across all of the Availability Zones assigned to the app. Pivotal recommends using at least three availability zones for a highly available installation of your chosen runtime.

1. Select **Create Availability Zones**.

    <%= image_tag("../common/images/create-az.png") %>

1. Use the following steps to create one or more Availability Zones for your apps to use:
    * Click **Add**.
    * Enter a unique **Name** for the Availability Zone.
    * Enter the name of an existing vCenter **Cluster** to use as an Availability Zone.
    * **(Optional)** Enter the name of a **Resource Pool** in the vCenter cluster that you specified above. The jobs running in this Availability Zone share the CPU and memory resources defined by the pool.
    * **(Optional)** Click **Add Cluster** to create another set of **Cluster** and **Resource Pool** fields. You can add multiple clusters. Click the trash icon to delete a cluster. The first cluster cannot be deleted.
    <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> For the PAS runtime, see
<a href="https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-1/customizing/understand-az.html">Availability Zones in vSphere</a> for additional information.</p>


1. Click **Save**.


## <a id='create-networks'></a> Step 5: Create Networks Page

1. Select **Create Networks**.

    <%= image_tag("../common/images/create-network.png") %>

1. Select **Enable ICMP checks** to enable ICMP on your networks. Ops Manager uses ICMP checks to confirm that components within your network are reachable.

1. Depending on the runtime you are deploying, do one of the following:

  1. For PAS, use the following steps to create one or more Ops Manager networks:
      * Click **Add Network**.
      * Enter a unique **Name** for the network.
      * Click **Add Subnet** to create one or more subnets for the network.
      * Enter the full path and **vSphere Network Name** as it displays in vCenter. For example, enter `YOUR-DIRECTORY-NAME/YOUR-NETWORK-NAME`. If your vSphere Network Name contains a forward slash character, replace the forward slash with the URL-encoded forward slash character `%2f`.
      * For **CIDR**, enter a valid CIDR block in which to deploy VMs. For example, enter `192.0.2.0/24`.
      * For **Reserved IP Ranges**, enter any IP addresses from the **CIDR**
      that you do not want BOSH to use in your installation. Ops Manager will not deploy VMs to any address in this range.
      * Enter your **DNS** and **Gateway** IP addresses.
      * Select which **Availability Zones** to use with the network.
  1. For PKS, create the following Ops Manager networks:
      * `infrastructure`: This network is for Ops Manager, the BOSH Director, the PKS broker, and the PKS API.
      * `main`: If you have a large deployment with multiple tiles, you can choose to deploy the PKS broker and PKS API to a separate network named `pks-main`. See the table below for more information.
      * `services`: Network for creating the master and worker VMs for Kubernetes clusters. The CIDR should not conflict with the pod overlay network `10.200.0.0/16` or the reserved Kubernetes services CIDR of `10.100.200.0/24`.
      <br><br>
      Use the values from the following table as a guide when you create each network, replacing the IP addresses with ranges that are available in your vSphere environment:
      <table>
