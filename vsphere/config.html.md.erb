This topic describes how to configure the BOSH Director tile for VMware vSphere.
You can also perform the procedures in this topic using the Ops Manager API.
For more information, see
[Using the Ops Manager API](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/<%= product_info['local_product_version'].to_s.sub('.','-') %>/customizing/ops-man-api.html).

<p class="note warning"><strong>WARNING:</strong> If you are installing Pivotal Container Service (PKS)
on vSphere with NSX-T integration, follow the instructions in
<a href="https://docs.pivotal.io/pks/vsphere-nsxt-om-config.html">Configuring BOSH Director with NSX-T for PKS</a>
instead of performing the steps provided in this topic.</p>

## <a id="prerequisites"></a> Prerequisites

Before you begin this procedure, you must complete all steps in [Deploying Ops Manager on vSphere](./deploy.html).

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Pivotal strongly recommends installing PAS and PKS on separate instances of Ops Manager for security reasons. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.pivotal.io/pks/pas-and-pks.html">PAS and PKS Deployments with Ops Manager</a>.</p>

## <a id="set-up"></a> Step 1: Set Up Ops Manager

1. In a web browser, navigate to the fully qualified domain of your Ops Manager.

1. When Ops Manager starts for the first time, you must choose one of the following:
    * [Use an Identity Provider](#idp): If you choose **Use an Identity Provider**, an external
      identity server maintains your user database.
    * [Internal Authentication](#internal): If you choose **Internal Authentication**, Ops Manager
      maintains your user database.

    <%= image_tag("../common/images/select-authentication.png") %>

### <a id='idp'></a> Use an Identity Provider

<%= partial '../common/using_idp_ops_manager' %>

### <a id='internal'></a> Use Internal Authentication

1.  When redirected to the **Internal Authentication** page, you must complete the following steps:
    * Enter a **Username**, **Password**, and **Password confirmation** to create an Admin user.
    * Enter a **Decryption passphrase** and the **Decryption passphrase confirmation**. This passphrase encrypts the Ops Manager datastore, and is not recoverable.
    * If you are using an **HTTP proxy** or **HTTPS proxy**, follow the instructions in [Configuring Proxy Settings for the BOSH CPI](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/<%= product_info['local_product_version'].to_s.sub('.','-') %>/customizing/pcf-director-proxy-settings.html).
    * Read the **End User License Agreement**, and select the checkbox to accept the terms.
    * Click **Setup Authentication**.

## <a id='vcenter-config'></a> Step 2: vCenter Configs Page

1. Log in to Ops Manager with the Admin username and password that you created in the previous step.

1. Click the **BOSH Director** tile.

1. Select **vCenter Config**. Configure the one or more vCenters that host your PCF foundation. The following image shows the **vCenter Config** pane.
    <%= image_tag("../common/images/vcenter-config.png", :alt => "At the top of the image is the header 'vCenter Config', across from which on the far right is a gray, rectangular button labeled 'Add vCenter Config'. Underneath these is a horizonal line. Below the line are text fields labeled, from top to bottom, 'Name', 'vCenter Host', 'vCenter Username', 'vCenter Password', and 'Datacenter Name'. All of these text fields have red asterisks, to denote that they are required fields. The Name field contains the text 'first-vcenter'. The vCenter Host field contains the text '10.87.41.6'. The vCenter Username field contains the text 'opsmgr@vsphere.local'. The vCenter Password field contains eight asterisks and has the word 'Change' underneath in blue letters to indicate that it is clickable. The Datacenter Name field contains the text 'six'. Below the Datacenter Name field is a dropdown labeled 'Virtual Disk Type', with a red asterisk and the 'thin' option selected. Below this dropdown is a text field labeled 'Ephemeral Datastore Names (comma delimited)', with a red asterisk and containing the text 'freenas-smurfs'. Below this field is the text 'NOTE: Removing an Ephemeral Datastore after an initial deploy can result in a system outage and/or data loss.' Below this text is another text field labeled 'Persistent Datastore Names (comma delimited)', with a red asterisk and containing the text 'freenas-smurfs'. Below this field is the text 'NOTE: Removing a Persistent Datastore after an initial deploy can result in a system outage and/or data loss.' Below this text are two radio buttons, one selected radio button labeled 'Standard vCenter Networking', and one radio button labeled 'NSX Networking'. Below these radio buttons are the grayed-out words 'NSX Mode' with a red asterisk and two grayed-out options underneath: one selected radio button labeled 'NSX-V', and one radio button labeled 'NSX-T'. Below these are three grayed-out text fields with red asterisks and one grayed-out text area, labeled, from top to bottom: 'NSX Address', 'NSX Username', 'NSX Password', and 'NSX CA Cert'.") %>
1. Complete the fields on the **vCenter Config** pane as follows:
    * **Name**: A name that you provide for your vCenter configuration. This field is used to identify the datacenter configuration in Ops Manager if you are configuring multiple datacenters.
    * **vCenter Host**: The hostname of the vCenter that manages ESXi/vSphere.
    * **vCenter Username**: A vCenter username with create and delete privileges for virtual machines (VMs) and folders.
    * **vCenter Password**: The password for the vCenter user specified above.
    * **Datacenter Name**: The name of the datacenter as it appears in vCenter.
    * **Virtual Disk Type**: The Virtual Disk Type to provision for all VMs. For guidance about the virtual disk type to select, see [Provisioning a Virtual Disk in vSphere](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/<%= product_info['local_product_version'].to_s.sub('.','-') %>/customizing/disk-format.html).
    <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> The following fields do not allow whitespace. Including whitespace characters in datastore or datastore folder names causes an error.</p>
    * **Ephemeral Datastore Names (comma delimited)**: The names of the datastores that store ephemeral VM disks deployed by Ops Manager.
    * **Persistent Datastore Names (comma delimited)**: The names of the datastores that store persistent VM disks deployed by Ops Manager.
    * **VM Folder**: The vSphere datacenter folder where Ops Manager places VMs. This defaults to `pcf_vms`.
    * **Template Folder**: The vSphere datacenter folder where Ops Manager places VMs. This defaults to `pcf_templates`.
    * **Disk path Folder**: The vSphere datastore folder where Ops Manager creates attached disk images. This defaults to `pcf_disk`. You must not nest this folder.

1. Select a network configuration from one of the following:
    * **Standard vCenter Networking**: This is the default option when upgrading Ops Manager.
    * **NSX Networking**: Select this option to enable VMware NSX Network Virtualization.
    Configure NSX networking by entering the following information:
        * **NSX Mode**: Select either **NSX-V** or **NSX-T**.
        <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> If you want to configure NSX Networking for PKS,
        you must select <strong>NSX-T</strong>. For more information about NSX Networking for PKS,
        see the <a href="https://docs.pivotal.io/pks/vsphere-nsxt-om-config.html#vcenter-config">Configure vCenter for PKS</a> section of <em>Configuring BOSH Director with NSX-T for PKS</em>.</p>

        * **NSX Username**: The username to connect to the NSX manager.
        * **NSX Password**: The password for the username specified above.
        * **NSX CA Cert**: A CA certificate in PEM format that authenticates to the NSX server.
        If the NSX Manager generated a self-signed certificate, use the following command to retrieve the CA certificate using OpenSSL:

            ```
            openssl s_client -showcerts -connect NSX-MANAGER-ADDRESS:443 < /dev/null 2> /dev/null | openssl x509
            ```
            Where `NSX-MANAGER-ADDRESS` is the address of the NSX manager.

## <a id='create-az'></a> Step 4: Create Availability Zones Page

An Ops Manager availability zone (AZ) corresponds to your vCenter clusters and resource pools.

Multiple AZs allow you to provide high-availability and load balancing to your applications. When you run more than one instance of an application, Ops Manager balances those instances across all of the AZs assigned to the application.

Pivotal recommends that you use at least three AZs for a highly available installation of your chosen runtime.

1. Select **Create Availability Zones** to navigate to the pane.

    <%= image_tag("../common/images/create-az.png", :alt => "The 'Create Availability Zones' pane shows a list of two availability zones: 'first-az' and 'second-az' with a button to the right to 'Add'. The 'first-az' is expanded and shows the fields 'Name' and 'IaaS Configuration'. Below that, still in the expanded 'first-az', a subhead called 'Clusters' lists a group of two fields, 'Cluster' and 'Resource Pool' with a button to the right to 'Add Cluster'.") %>

1. Use the following steps to create one or more AZs for your applications to use:
    * Click **Add**.
    * Enter a unique **Name** for the AZ.
    * Select a vCenter config name from the **IaaS Configuration** dropdown to associate your AZ with a vCenter. If you have only one vCenter config or if you are creating your first AZ, **IaaS Configuration** defaults to the first vCenter and cannot be configured.
    * Enter the name of an existing vCenter **Cluster** to use as an AZ.
    * **(Optional)** Enter the name of a **Resource Pool** in the vCenter cluster that you specified above. The jobs running in this AZ share the CPU and memory resources defined by the pool.
    * **(Optional)** Click **Add Cluster** to create another set of **Cluster** and **Resource Pool** fields. You can add multiple clusters. Click the trash icon to delete a cluster. The first cluster cannot be deleted.
    <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> For the PAS runtime, see
<a href="https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/<%= product_info['local_product_version'].to_s.sub('.','-') %>/customizing/understand-az.html">Availability Zones in vSphere</a> for additional information.</p>

1. Click **Save**.


## <a id='create-networks'></a> Step 5: Create Networks Page

1. Select **Create Networks**.

    <%= image_tag("../common/images/create-network.png") %>

1. Select **Enable ICMP checks** to enable ICMP on your networks. Ops Manager uses ICMP checks to confirm that components within your network are reachable.

1. Depending on the runtime that you are deploying, do one of the following:

  1. For PAS, use the following steps to create one or more Ops Manager networks:
      * Click **Add Network**.
      * Enter a unique **Name** for the network.
      * Click **Add Subnet** to create one or more subnets for the network.
      * Enter the full path and **vSphere Network Name** as it displays in vCenter. For example, enter `YOUR-DIRECTORY-NAME/YOUR-NETWORK-NAME`. If your vSphere Network Name contains a forward slash character, replace the forward slash with the URL-encoded forward slash character `%2f`.
      * For **CIDR**, enter a valid CIDR block in which to deploy VMs. For example, enter `192.0.2.0/24`.
      * For **Reserved IP Ranges**, enter any IP addresses from the **CIDR**
      that you want to blacklist from the installation. Ops Manager will not deploy VMs to any address in this range.
      * Enter your **DNS** and **Gateway** IP addresses.
      * Select which **Availability Zones** to use with the network.
  1. For PKS, create the following Ops Manager networks:
      * `infrastructure`: This network is for Ops Manager, the BOSH Director, the PKS broker, and the PKS API.
      * `pks`: If you have a large deployment with multiple tiles, you can choose to deploy the PKS broker and PKS API to a separate network named `main`. See the table below for more information.
      * `services`: Network for creating the master and worker VMs for Kubernetes clusters. The CIDR should not conflict with the pod overlay network `10.200.0.0/16` or the reserved Kubernetes services CIDR of `10.100.200.0/24`.
      <br><br>
      Use the values from the following table as a guide when you create each network, replacing the IP addresses with ranges that are available in your vSphere environment:
      <table>
        <tr>
