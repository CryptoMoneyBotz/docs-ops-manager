    1. **Select a resource**
        1. Select the resource you want to use to launch the VM and click **Next**.
            <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Hardware virtualization must be off if your vSphere host does not support VT-x/EPT.</p>

    1. **Select storage**
        1. Select a disk format. For information about disk formats, see [Provisioning a Virtual Disk](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-1/customizing/disk-format.html).
            <p class="note warning"><strong>Warning</strong>: Ops Manager requires a Director VM with at least 8&nbsp;GB memory.</p>
        1. Select a storage destination.
        1. Click **Next**.

        1. In the **Admin Password** field, enter a default password for the account with the username `ubuntu`. Alternatively, you can enter a pre-existing SSH key value in the **Public SSH Key** field. 
            <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: You must specify a default password, an SSH key, or both. If you do not have either of these fields configured, Ops Manager will not boot up.</p>
        1. Complete the remaining network information and passwords for the Ops Manager VM admin user.
            <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Record this network information. The IP Address will be the location of the Ops Manager interface.</p>

1. With the VM selected, click **Actions** > **Power** > **Power On**. Once the VM boots, the interface is available at the IP address you specified.

     <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: It is normal to experience a brief delay before the interface is accessible while the web server and VM start up.</p>

1. Create a DNS entry for the IP address that you used for Ops Manager. You must use this fully qualified domain name when you log in to Ops Manager
as described in the [Set Up Ops Manager](config.html#set-up) section of _Configuring BOSH Director on vSphere_.
