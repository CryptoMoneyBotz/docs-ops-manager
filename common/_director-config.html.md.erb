<%# OVERVIEW
This partial is the procedure for the **Director Config** pane in the BOSH Director.
IaaS-specific information is separated with `if` statements.

PARTIAL REFERENCES
This partial is called in all IaaS-specific BOSH Director configuration topics.
%>

1. In Ops Manager, select **Director Config**.

    <%= image_tag("../common/images/director-config.png", :width => "500", :alt => "") %>

<%# **NTP Servers** field, differentiated by IaaS %>

<%# For OpenStack: %>
<% if current_page.data.iaas == "OpenStack" %>
1. Enter one or more NTP servers in the **NTP Servers (comma
delimited)** field. For example, `us.pool.ntp.org`.



<%# For GCP: %>
<% elsif current_page.data.iaas == "GCP" %>
1. In the **NTP Servers (comma delimited)** field, enter `169.254.169.254` to designate the `metadata.google.internal` host as NTP server.



<%# For AWS: %>
<% elsif current_page.data.iaas == "AWS" %>
1. Enter at least two of the following NTP servers in the **NTP Servers (comma delimited)**
field, separated by a comma: `0.amazon.pool.ntp.org,1.amazon.pool.ntp.org,2.amazon.pool.ntp.org,3.amazon.pool.ntp.org`.



<%# For other IaaSes such as vSphere and Azure: %>
<% else %>
1. In the **NTP Servers (comma delimited)** field, enter a comma-separated list of valid NTP servers.
<% end %>

    <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> The NTP server configuration only updates
    after VM recreation. Ensure that you select the <strong>Recreate all VMs</strong> checkbox
    if you modify the value of this field.</p>


1. Leave the **JMX Provider IP Address** field blank.


1. Leave the **Bosh HM Forwarder IP Address** field blank.
<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> Starting in PAS v2.0, BOSH-reported component
metrics are available in the Loggregator Firehose by default. If you continue to use
the BOSH HM Forwarder to consume these component metrics, you may receive duplicate data.
To prevent this, leave the <strong>Bosh HM Forwarder IP Address</strong> field blank.</p>



1. Select the **Enable VM Resurrector Plugin** checkbox to enable the BOSH
Resurrector functionality and increase your runtime availability. <% if current_page.data.iaas == "vSphere" %>If you intend to install PAS,
  see [Using the BOSH Resurrector](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/customizing/resurrector.html) for more information about the Resurrector plugin.<% end %>



1. Select **Enable Post Deploy Scripts** to run a post-deploy script after deployment.
This script allows the job to execute additional commands against a deployment.
<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> If you intend to install <%= vars.k8s_runtime_full %> (<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %>), you must enable post-deploy scripts.</p>


1. Select **Recreate all VMs** to force BOSH to recreate all VMs on the next deploy.
This process does not destroy any persistent disk data.


1. Select **Recreate All Persistent Disks** to force BOSH to migrate and recreate persistent
disks for the BOSH Director and all tiles. This process does not destroy any persistent disk data.


1. Select **Enable bosh deploy retries** to instruct Ops Manager to retry failed
BOSH operations up to five times.

1. Select **Skip Director Drain Lifecycle** to prevent drain scripts from running when the BOSH Director is recreated.

1. Select **Store BOSH Job Credentials on tmpfs (beta)** to store credentials for BOSH jobs on temporary file storage (tmpfs) memory, rather than on disk. You must recreate all VMs for this setting to take effect.

1. Select **Keep Unreachable Director VMs** if you want to preserve BOSH Director VMs after a failed deployment for troubleshooting purposes.

1. Select **HM Pager Duty Plugin** to enable Health Monitor integration with PagerDuty.<br>
    <%= image_tag("../common/images/director_hm_pager.png") %>
    * **Service Key**: Enter your API service key from PagerDuty.
    * **HTTP Proxy**: Enter an HTTP proxy for use with PagerDuty.



1. Select **HM Email Plugin** to enable Health Monitor integration with email.

    <%= image_tag("../common/images/director_hm_email.png") %>
    * **Host**: Enter your email hostname.
    * **Port**: Enter your email port number.
    * **Domain**: Enter your domain.
    * **From**: Enter the address for the sender.
    * **Recipients**: Enter comma-separated addresses of intended recipients.
    * **Username**: Enter the username for your email server.
    * **Password**: Enter the password for your email server.
    * **Enable TLS**: Select this checkbox to enable Transport Layer Security to the email host.

1. (Optional) Modify the **Director Workers** value,
  which sets the number of workers available to execute
  Director tasks. This field defaults to `5`.



1. (Optional) **Max Threads** sets the maximum number of
  threads that the BOSH Director can run simultaneously. Pivotal
  recommends that you leave the field blank to use the default
  value, unless doing so results in rate limiting or errors on your IaaS.



1. (Optional) To add a custom URL for your BOSH Director,
  enter a valid hostname in **Director Hostname**. You can
  also use this field to configure a load balancer in front
  of your BOSH Director. For more information, see [How to Set Up a Load Balancer in Front of Operations Manager Director](https://community.pivotal.io/s/article/How-to-Set-Up-a-Load-Balancer-in-Front-of-Ops-Manager-Director) in the Pivotal Support Knowlege Base.<br/>
