1. In **Trusted Certificates**, enter your custom certificate authority (CA) certificates to insert into your organization's certificate trust chain. This feature enables all BOSH-deployed components in your deployment to trust custom root certificates.
  <br><br>To enter multiple certificates, paste your certificates one after the other. For example, format your certificates like the following:
  <pre>-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
ABCDEFGH12345678ABCDEFGH12345678ABCDEFGH12345678AB
EFGH12345678ABCDEFGH12345678ABCDEFGH12345678ABCDEF
GH12345678ABCDEFGH12345678ABCDEFGH12345678...
------END CERTIFICATE------
-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
BCDEFGH12345678ABCDEFGH12345678ABCDEFGH12345678ABB
EFGH12345678ABCDEFGH12345678ABCDEFGH12345678ABCDEF
GH12345678ABCDEFGH12345678ABCDEFGH12345678...
------END CERTIFICATE------
-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
CDEFGH12345678ABCDEFGH12345678ABCDEFGH12345678ABBB
EFGH12345678ABCDEFGH12345678ABCDEFGH12345678ABCDEF
GH12345678ABCDEFGH12345678ABCDEFGH12345678...
------END CERTIFICATE------</pre>
  <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> If you want to use Docker registries to run <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> app instances in Docker containers, enter the certificate for your private Docker registry in this field. See <a href="https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/<%= product_info['local_product_version'].to_s.sub('.','-') %>/opsguide/docker-registry.html">Using Docker Registries</a> for more information about running app instances in <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> using Docker registries.</p>

1. (Optional) Select the **Include OpsManager Root CA in Trusted Certs** checkbox to include the Ops Manager root CA in the Trusted Certificates field. BOSH Director includes this CA in the trust store of every VM that it deploys.
