### <a id="general-prereqs"></a> General Prerequisites

Before you perform the procedures in this topic, you must have completed the procedures in the following topics:

* The [Preparing to Deploy PCF on Azure](prepare-env-manual.html) topic
* Either the [Launching an Ops Manager Director Instance with an ARM Template](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-0/customizing/azure-arm-template.html) topic or the [Launching an Ops Manager Director Instance on Azure without an ARM Template](deploy-manual.html) topic

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> You can also perform the procedures in this topic using the Ops Manager API. For more information, see the <a href="https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-0/customizing/ops-man-api.html">Using the Ops Manager API</a> topic.</p>

### <a id="stack-gov-prereqs"></a> Prerequisites for Azure Stack or Azure Government Cloud

If you are using Azure Stack or Azure Government Cloud, you must set custom VM types for a successful deployment. You can set custom VM types with the Ops Manager API. For more information, see [Using the Ops Manager API](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-0/customizing/ops-man-api.html).

To set custom VM types, see the following information.

* **For Azure Stack:** The example below may not have up-to-date VM types. For a current list of supported Azure Stack VM types that you can include in your API call, see [Virtual Machine Sizes](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-stack/user/azure-stack-vm-considerations#virtual-machine-sizes) from the Azure Stack documentation. Include at least one `Standard` VM type.

* **For Azure Government:** See the example `curl` command below for your list of VM types.
