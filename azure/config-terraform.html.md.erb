owner: Ops Manager
iaas: Azure
---


This topic describes how to configure the BOSH Director tile within Ops Manager on Azure after [Deploying Ops Manager to Azure Using Terraform](./prepare-env-terraform.html).

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> You can also perform the procedures in this topic using the Ops Manager API. For more information, see the <a href="https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-1/customizing/ops-man-api.html">Using the Ops Manager API</a> topic.</p>


## <a id='prereq'></a> Prerequisite

To complete the procedures in this topic, you must have access to the output from when you ran `terraform apply` to create resources for this deployment. You can view this output at any time by running `terraform output`. You use the values in your Terraform output to configure the BOSH Director tile.


## <a id='access-om'></a> Step 1: Access Ops Manager

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> For security, Ops Manager v1.7 and later require that you log in using a fully qualified domain name.</a></p> 

1. In a web browser, navigate to the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of the BOSH Director. Use the `ops_manager_dns` value from running `terraform output`.

1. When Ops Manager starts for the first time, you must choose one of the following:
    * [Use an Identity Provider](#idp): If you use an Identity Provider, an external identity server maintains your user database.
    * [Internal Authentication](#internal): If you use Internal Authentication, Ops Manager maintains your user database.

    <%= image_tag("../common/images/select-authentication.png") %>

### <a id='idp'></a> Use an Identity Provider (IdP)

<%= partial '../common/using_idp_ops_manager' %> 

### <a id='internal'></a> Internal Authentication

1. When redirected to the **Internal Authentication** page, do the following:
    * Enter a **Username**, **Password**, and **Password confirmation** to create an Admin user.
    * Enter a **Decryption passphrase** and the **Decryption passphrase confirmation**. This passphrase encrypts the Ops Manager datastore, and is not recoverable if lost.
    * If you are using an **HTTP proxy** or **HTTPS proxy**, follow the instructions in the [Configuring Proxy Settings for the BOSH CPI](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-1/customizing/pcf-director-proxy-settings.html) topic.
    * Read the **End User License Agreement**, and select the checkbox to accept the terms.
    * Click **Setup Authentication**.
